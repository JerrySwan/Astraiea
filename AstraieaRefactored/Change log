Objectives = 

1) VD with generic "generatorOutput" object.
2) Remove repeated code in Layer2 (repeated between datapoint and timeseries, removed because now both are just "generatorOutput")
3) Artefacts more generic as Jerry instructed
4) Generators more generic so people can use complex structures

Stress to Jerry - how can we improve this !!!!!!WITH MINIMAL REFACTORING!!!!!!!



Generics = 

SetOfExperiments: T extends GeneratorOutput because it is required for Generator
	SetOfMultiArtefactExperiments, SetOf1ArtefactExperiments inherits from SetOfExperiments
SetOfComparisons: T extends GeneratorOutput because required for SetOfExperiments
Layer2: T extends GeneratorOutput because otherwise can't require some methods to have timeseries or artefact
		The T in Layer2 methods is to ensure timeseries methods use timseries, artefact methods use artefacts
CensoringStrategy uses T because Layer2 does
Layer1 has to use it because Layer2 does! 
Same with incrementingStrategy! This is endless!
Vargha Delaney due to Layer1

QUESTION - replace e.g. SetOfExperiments, SetOfComparisons with class or
