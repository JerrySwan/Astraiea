\section{Experimental Results (Sun Nov 22 09:39:25 GMT 2015)}
Experiments were performed using the \textsc{Astraiea}\footnote{This file has been automatically generated by Astraiea} statistical testing framework \cite{Neumann:2014:EET:2598394.2609850},
which performs tests in accordance with the guidelines of ``A Hitchhikers guide to statistical testing''
by Briand and Arcuri~\cite{Arcuri2012}.
Unless a different reference is given, the tests are performed as described in this paper.

Statistical testing was carried out as follows: \begin{itemize}
\item{The Brunner Munzel P Value significance test was used followed by the Vargha Delaney effect size test. Brunner Munzel is used in place of the  Wilcoxon/ Mann Whitney U test recommended in Arcuri's paper~\cite{Arcuri2012} because the Brunner Munzel test is tolerant of heteroscedastic data whereas the Wilcoxon/ Mann Whitney U test is not~\cite{Brunner2000}.}
\item{These results were obtained with 20 samples in each dataset}
\end{itemize}Results:
\begin{itemize}
\item{difference is significant (p value of 3.4037320961743944E-6, threshold of 0.05)}
\item{the effect size is 0.8374999999999999, confidence intervals (obtained by bootstrapping)= 0.69375 - 0.9400000000000001}
\item{dataA is greater than dataB}
