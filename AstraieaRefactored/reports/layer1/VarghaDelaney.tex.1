\section{Experimental Results (Wed Feb 17 08:55:57 GMT 2016)}
Experiments were performed using the \textsc{Astraiea}\footnote{This file has been automatically generated by Astraiea} statistical testing framework \cite{Neumann:2014:EET:2598394.2609850},
which performs tests in accordance with the guidelines of ``A Hitchhikers guide to statistical testing''
by Briand and Arcuri~\cite{Arcuri2012}.
Unless a different reference is given, the tests are performed as described in this paper.

Statistical testing was carried out as follows: \begin{itemize}
\item{Using the default testing configuration: Wilcoxon/ Mann Whitney U Statistical Tests and Vargha Delaney Effect size tests.}
\item{These results were obtained with 20 samples in each dataset}
\end{itemize}
\textcolor{Red}{WARNING: Since the data contains ties or zeros, a non exact version of the Mann Whitney U test was used
}
Results:
\begin{itemize}
\item{difference is significant (p value of 2.544222740505919E-4, threshold of 0.05)}
\item{the effect size is 0.8374999999999999, confidence intervals (obtained by bootstrapping)= 0.69375 - 0.9400000000000001}
\item{dataA is greater than dataB}
\end{itemize}Statistical testing was carried out as follows: \begin{itemize}
\item{Using the default testing configuration: Wilcoxon/ Mann Whitney U Statistical Tests and Vargha Delaney Effect size tests.}
\item{These results were obtained with 50 samples in each dataset}
