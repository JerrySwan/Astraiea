\section{Experimental Results (Wed Nov 25 17:42:10 GMT 2015)}
Experiments were performed using the \textsc{Astraiea}\footnote{This file has been automatically generated by Astraiea} statistical testing framework \cite{Neumann:2014:EET:2598394.2609850},
which performs tests in accordance with the guidelines of ``A Hitchhikers guide to statistical testing''
by Briand and Arcuri~\cite{Arcuri2012}.
Unless a different reference is given, the tests are performed as described in this paper.

Statistical testing was carried out as follows: 
This data was obtained from runs on multiple artefacts. Each artefact is treated as a single run for the purpose of statistical comparison and so, the experimental description below,  the number of runs refers to the number of artefacts. For each artefact 1 repeated tests were carried out and the median of these results was used as the result for that artefact for the purposes of subsequent statistical testing.\begin{itemize}
\item{All experiments were repeated 30 times ($n$=30)}
\item{The data is dichotomous and paired and so the Fisher test of statistical significance was used followed by the Odds Ratio test of effect size.These tests compare boolean values, denoting a pass or a fail, from the final point in the result time series. }
\end{itemize}A complete list of p value tests carried out is shown in table~\ref{p value tests}, with $n$ corresponding to the number of samples in each data set.

The final test, and the test on which effect size was calculated, was carried out using an $n$ of 30. The initial censoring strategy was used (using a dichotomous test on the results at the end of the time series). 

The final results from comparing null and null are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item{data is not significant (p value of 0.4219753810198912, threshold of 0.05)}
